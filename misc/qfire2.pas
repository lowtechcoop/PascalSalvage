  PL> Ummm... No.
  PL> ModeQ is 256x256x256 LINEAR ADDRESSING...  No bank

 BN> I meant plane switching... I was sure I wrote that. Ho hum. Now I

 BN> Yeah, yeah, I see the putpixel. I always thought that 256x256 was only

 BN> How do you set it?

 BH> Take a look at this ModeQ Fire, i just converted it from the other one in

I've finally got around to looking at it, and I spent about 20minutes and
came up with this... There ain't much left, but it BURNS along now :)

Its now in ModeQ/2 (256x128x256) to make the fire "taller", and I moved lots
of it to asm, and then removed the virtual screen (why we need virt screen
junk? :)

   making this a modeQ/2, or 256x128x256 :).  BTW: 12.5x80x16 is a fun
