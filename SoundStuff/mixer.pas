{ Program by Borek (Marcin Borkowski), Warsaw, Poland.
  You can find me in a Top Secret BBS, +48 2 6788783
  Fido 2:480/25, Pascal Net 115:4804/104

  You may freely copy and use this source, as long it is
  unchanged and states my name in the begining. If you find
  more profitable use of this code, fell free to share your
  profits with me! At least - let me know you were able to
  use it for your own purposes.

  This unit should be accompanied by the MODPLAY source.

  This version of mixing (even at 44 kHz) works OK on my
  UMC 40 MHz machine (that's a little bit less than 486 50 MHz).
  If you want to make it work on 386DX 33MHz, you must 'unroll'
  the main loop and put used there data into 'hardcoded' variables.
  Such a version works on my old 386 and on several other
  computers of the same class, even with QEMM.

  If you stop this program by ctrl break, you may not be able to
  restart it without resetting your computer - and that's not the
  only one bug I know in the code.

  Parts of code ripped from PCPGE, various sources from
  Ethan Brodsky and probably from SWAG. I can't remember
  source of every byte, but for sure 95% of code is mine. }
