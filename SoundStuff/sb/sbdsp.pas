(*    Version 0.5�: Would not play samples across a page boundary correctly*)
(*                  (I *was* getting VERY angry!)                          *)
(*    Version 1.0�: FINALLY works across page breaks, and now I shall      *)
(*                  proceed to create a way to play from a virtual mem     *)

(*    Version 1.01: Allright, now the unit will also work by transfering a *)
(*                  file straight from disk (by using 1 buffer of 64K in   *)
(*                  low memory). The reason that I didn't want to use      *)
(*                  Ethan Brodsky's Unit is because he would load the      *)
(*                  ENTIRE VOC file into memory at once, thus drastically  *)
(*                  reducing the amnt. of memory available to the rest of  *)
(*                  my program. (I load the file from disk in 32K chunks)  *)
(*                  However, I do admire the fact that he was able to play *)
(*                  VOC files quite nicely and efficiently!                *)
(*    Version 1.1 : Now, support for 8-bit Stereo files, and the SBPRO     *)
(*                  mixer have been added in.                              *)
(*    Version 1.11: The Basic module for FM playing has been added in a    *)
(*                  seperate unit called SBFM. Also expanded available     *)
(*                  range of IRQ levels for a sound card in order to       *)
(*                  maintain compatibility with some older versions. Plus, *)
(*                  have added the "High Speed DMA" mode, which allows     *)
(*                  playback of samples which were recorded at > 22KHz     *)
(*    Version 1.2:  Added "mixing" capabilities, however, they are still a *)
(*                  bit primitive though (and computationally expensive)   *)
(*    Version 1.21: Cleaned up the interface section a bit, and got rid of *)
(*                  IntHandlerInstalled from the Interface (Thanks goes to *)
(*                  Paul Merkus! :) ), also fixed the MixSample procedure  *)
(*                  so that it can mix samples that don't have the same    *)

(*                  samples over the GUS! I haven't tested it yet, but it  *)

(*                  test out my routines on the GUS)                       *)
(*    Version 1.22: Made the sample type a PChar, since pointer arithmetic *)
(*                  is only defined for that type (in Turbo Pascal v7.0)   *)
(*    Version 1.3 : FIXED A HUGE BUG!! High-Speed DMA xfers would not play *)
(*                  back correctly, and would leave the system hanging! My *)
(*                  code now compensates for this occurence! (phew)        *)
(*    Version 1.3B: Bundled with the VOC2RPD program for ease of use!      *)
(*    Version 1.31: Fixed a slight bug with PlaySoundRPD, which would give *)
(*                  a disk read error on some very small RPD files. I have *)
(*                  also provided two functions which change and check on  *)
(*                  the size of the sound buffer. (This prevents the       *)
(*                  programmer from changing the size of the buffer while  *)
(*                  the program is playing sound!)                         *)
(*    Version 1.31B:  Bundled with the VOC2RPD program AND the WAV2RPD     *)
(*                  program for WAV file conversion.                       *)
(*   *Version 2.0�:   WOW! It seems like much of the code in this unit has *)
(*                  evolved rather quickly (in the space of 3 months!), and*)
(*                  I am already at the second MAJOR release! This �eta    *)
(*                  test unit is for people who need Double Buffering more *)
(*                  than anything else. 2 Procedures have been disabled:   *)
(*                  MixSamples, and PlaySoundDSK. These 2 have to be       *)
(*                  converted over to Double Buffering, so since this is a *)
(*                  �eta, I do not have the time to convert ALL functions  *)
(*                  over. Also note that I have added the FRAMEWORK for    *)
(*                  16-bit sound, but they are NOT functional yet! I am    *)
(*                  still working on it, and if you try to play 16-bit     *)
(*                  sound, you are likely to get garbage played back!      *)
(*                  Version 2.0 should fix all of these items.             *)
(*                    This version also allows for REAL-TIME voice         *)
(*                  amplification, but since it would take a lot of CPU    *)
(*                  horsepower to multiply by a Floating Point amp value,  *)
(*                  I had to cut down the values that can be used for      *)
(*                  amplification. The reason that we are able to do REAL  *)
(*                  TIME Voice amplification is because I am using Double  *)
(*                  Buffers, this way, while one sound is being output,    *)
(*                  another will be calculating its voice level!           *)
(*                    I have fixed the re-entrancy problem (at least it    *)
(*                  appears as if I have fixed it ;-) ).                   *)
(*                    Also, recording was hastily thrown in (someone       *)
(*                  requested it), but is fixed at 8-bit Mono currently.   *)

(*   It appears as if I have FIXED the re-entrancy problems that I was     *)
