INT 33 - MS MOUSE - RESET DRIVER AND READ STATUS
	AX = 0000h
Return: AX = status
	    0000h hardware/driver not installed
	    FFFFh hardware/driver installed
	BX = number of buttons
	    0000h other than two
	    0002h two buttons (many drivers)
	    0003h Mouse Systems/Logitech three-button mouse
	    FFFFh two buttons
Notes:	to use mouse on a Hercules-compatible monographics card in graphics
	  mode, you must first set 0040h:0049h to 6 for page 0 or 5 for page 1,
	  and then call this function.	Logitech drivers v5.01 and v6.00
	  reportedly do not correctly use Hercules graphics in dual-monitor
	  systems, while version 4.10 does.
	the Logitech mouse driver contains the signature string "LOGITECH"
	  three bytes past the interrupt handler; many of the Logitech mouse
	  utilities check for this signature.
	Logitech MouseWare v6.30 reportedly does not support CGA video modes
	  if no CGA is present when it is started and the video board is
	  later switched into CGA emulation

INT 33 - MS MOUSE v1.0+ - HIDE MOUSE CURSOR

	BX = column of cursor hot spot in bitmap (-16 to 16)
	CX = row of cursor hot spot (-16 to 16)
	ES:DX -> mask bitmap (see #2802)
Notes:	in graphics modes, the screen contents around the current mouse cursor
	  position are ANDed with the screen mask and then XORed with the
	  cursor mask
	the Microsoft mouse driver v7.04 and v8.20 uses only BL and CL, so the
	  hot spot row/column should be limited to -128..127
	Microsoft KnowledgeBase article Q19850 states that the high bit is
	  right-most, but that statement is contradicted by all other available
	  documentation

--------M-33000C-----------------------------
INT 33 - MS MOUSE v1.0+ - DEFINE INTERRUPT SUBROUTINE PARAMETERS

	ES:DX -> update region list (see #2805)
Notes:	mouse cursor is hidden in the specified region, and needs to be
	  explicitly turned on again
	this version of the call is described in an August 1988 version of the

INT 33 - MS MOUSE v6.0+ - RESTORE DRIVER STATE
	AX = 0017h
	BX = size of buffer (see AX=0015h)
	ES:DX -> buffer containing saved state
Notes:	although not documented (since the Microsoft driver does not use it),
	  many drivers appear to require BX on input
	some mouse drivers range-check the values in the saved state based on
	  the current video mode; thus, the video mode should be restored
	  before the mouse driver's state is restored
SeeAlso: AX=0015h,AX=0016h

	    0018h if successful
	    FFFFh on error
Notes:	up to three handlers can be defined by separate calls to this function,
	  each with a different combination of shift states in the call mask;
	  calling this function again with a call mask of 0000h undefines the
	  specified handler (official documentation); specifying the same
	  call mask and an address of 0000h:0000h undefines the handler (real
	  life)
	some versions of the documentation erroneously reverse the order of
	  the bits in the call mask
SeeAlso: AX=000Ch,AX=0014h,AX=0019h

Bitfields for mouse call mask:
Bit(s)	Description	(Table 2806)

 2	call if left button released
 3	call if right button pressed

	CX = cursor column
	DX = cursor row

Notes:	the default parameter table array is located at F000h:E401h in 100%

	  for drives 81h-83h immediately following the parameter table pointed
	  at by INT 41, with a separate copy of the drive 81h table for INT 46.
	  The check for such an arrangement is to test whether INT 46 points

Notes:	[1] four of the keys can have differing scan codes, depending on the
	  actual keyboard; the BIOS accepts either scan code ("normal": 2Fh,
	  30h, 5Ah, 64h; "alternate": 2Dh,3Fh,5Eh,5Fh) for any of these keys
	[2] Shift-Print invokes INT 5E for a screen dump; the PRTSCRN.DEV
	  device driver also supports Alt-Print, Ctrl-Print, Shift-Alt-Print,
	  and Shift-Ctrl-Print for dumping graphics in various permutations
	[3] BRK/PAUS invokes INT 5C for a pause, then stuffs 0100h into the
	  keyboard buffer
	[4] Shift-BRK/PAUS invokes INT 5D for the Break, then stuffs 0000h
	  into the keyboard buffer; MS-DOS hooks INT 5D to keep the 0000h from
	  appearing in the keyboard buffer
	[5] on the TI Pro, one enters an arbitrary character slightly
	  differently than on a standard PC: exactly three numberpad digits
	  must be pressed (using leading zeros for codes less than 100), and
	  the key for the requested code is inserted into the keyboard buffer
	  immediately on pressing the third key.  The Alt key may be released
	  and re-pressed arbitrarily often between digits without affecting
	  the Alt-digit-digit-digit sequence.
	scan codes with bit 7 set are not key releases, but rather
	  auto-repeated keystrokes, which the BIOS only places into the
	  keyboard buffer if the buffer is empty at the time (thus avoiding
	  typeahead of repeated keystrokes faster than they can be processed)

	  current networks support NetBIOS as the session layer.
Note:	The Sytek PCnet card uses DMA 3.

Note:	The handler for the interrupt will start with a 2-byte NEAR jump

INT 60 - FTP Packet Driver - PC/TCP Packet Driver Specification
Range:	INT 20 to INT FF
Notes:	The handler for the interrupt will start with a 3-byte jump
	  instruction, followed by the ASCIZ string "PKT DRVR" (the
	  terminating NUL is significant).
	To find the interrupt being used by the driver, an application should
	  scan through interrupt vectors 20h to FFh (60h through 80h for
	  v1.09- of the specification) until it finds one with the "PKT DRVR"
	  string.
	AH values of 80h to FFh have been reserved for user-defined additions.

Program: MDEBUG is a shareware memory-resident debugging tool by Bernd

Notes:	MDEBUG uses INT 60 by default, but may be directed to any of INT 60
	  through INT 67; the interrupt handler is preceded by the signature
	  "USERINT" and is not chained
	if DS:SI points at a null byte, MDEBUG will prompt for a password if

	  INT 10h call (which MDEBUG uses while prompting for the password)
