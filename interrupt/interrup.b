	DL = drive (if bit 7 is set both hard disks and floppy disks reset)
Return: AH = status (see #0159)
	CF clear if successful (returned AH=00h)
	CF set on error
Note:	forces controller to recalibrate drive heads (seek to track 0)
	for PS/2 35SX, 35LS, 40SX and L40SX, as well as many other systems,
	  both the master drive and the slave drive respond to the Reset
	  function that is issued to either drive

INT 13 - 2M - FORMAT TRACK
	AX = 057Fh
	SI = 324Dh ("2M")
	CH = track number
	DH = head number
	DL = drive number
	ES:BX -> boot sector of future 2M diskette
Return: CF set on error
	CF clear if successful
	AH = status (see #0159)
Program: 2M is a TSR developed by Ciriaco Garcia de Celis to support
	  non standard diskettes with 820-902/1476-1558K (5.25 DD/HD)
	  and 984-1066/1804-1886K/3608-3772K (3.5 DD/HD/ED)
Notes:	it is not necessary to call AH=17h or AH=18h first (will be ignored)
	the diskette format must always begin on cylinder 0 head 0
	the boot sector can be obtained from an already-formatted 2M diskette
	  (by calling AH=02h with head number 00h in 2M v1.x and with head
	  number 80h for 2M v2+)
	the installation check for 2M must search for a "CiriSOFT:2M:1.3" or
	  "CiriSOFT:2MX:3.0" or similar (recomended ":2M:", ":2MX:", or ":2MB:"
	  substrings) in CiriSOFT TSR interface
	since 2M v2.0, the BOOT sector is emulated using the first physical
	  sector of FAT2; the second-sixth physical sectors of FAT2 in HD or ED
	  diskettes store the SuperBOOT code. To skip the FAT2 emulation (using
	  FAT1) of 2M, in order to read the SuperBOOT code, head number must be
	  80h-81h instead 0-1 (bit 7 active) in standard read/write functions.
	  This lets diskcopy programs format 2M target diskettes copying
	  SuperBOOT code. If the target diskette is already 2MF formatted
	  (containing boot code) this trick it is not necessary.
	when using STV technology (offset 65 of boot sector equal to 1) it is
	  necessary to write the full track before formatting (except track 0
	  side 0) to complete the format and skip future CRC errors on read; in
	  track 0 side 1 the head used must be 81h instead 1. Diskcopy programs
	  may do a format-write-verify sequential phases to improve performance

Notes:	block addresses must be in ascending order (for table B, cylinder is
	  most significant, byte from index least significant; for table C,
	  cylinder is most significant, sector number least significant)
	table B defect bytes from index of FFFFFFFFh indicates that the entire

	  a mapping context ensures that the associated program and data areas
	  are in memory for access.  Usable by drivers, TSRs and shared
	  programs.

Desc:	QEXT.SYS is Quarterdeck's HMA manager for DESQview; more recent

Note:	a private entry point (see #0353) may be found by searching the
	  beginning of the returned segment for the signature string
	  "QUARTERDECK EXTENDED MEMORY MANAGER 286"; the word immediately
	  prior to the signature contains the QEXT version number in BCD,
	  and the word prior to that contains the offset within the QEXT
	  code segment of the private entry point
