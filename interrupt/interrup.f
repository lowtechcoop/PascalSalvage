INT 21 - DOS 2+ - IOCTL - GET DEVICE INFORMATION
	AX = 4400h
	BX = handle
Return: CF clear if successful
	    DX = device information word (see #1076)
	    AX destroyed
	CF set on error
	    AX = error code (01h,05h,06h) (see #1332 at AH=59h/BX=0000h)

Notes:	the variant of the call requesting five bytes is an UNDOCUMENTED
	  extension supported by Adaptec's ASPI2DOS.SYS, ASPI4DOS.SYS, and
	  ASPI7DOS.SYS; if made of a host manager which does not support the
	  variant, only four bytes will be returned.  If the variant is
	  supported, Adaptec's WINASPI.DLL assumes that the host manager is
	  an "advanced" one which operates in either real or protected mode
	  (and thus does not require a DPMI INT 31/AX=0301h call to be invoked
	  from protected mode).	 Support of the five-byte variant also appears
	  to imply that an advanced ASPI host manager uses no temporary
	  storage space except the SRB (see #1107) and the stack, and that it
	  is fully reentrant.
	if called with a standard request for four bytes, even Adaptec's
	  advanced drivers return only the requested four bytes containing the
	  ASPI entry point address
	the function address is called with the address of a SCSI Request
	  Block (see #1107) on the stack and the caller must clean up the
	  stack

Notes:	there are a total of 378h bytes of configuration data for IPCUST.SYS
	  version 2.05.	 If less than the entire data is read or written,
	  the next read/write continues where the previous one ended; this
	  call and AX=4403h both reset the location at which the next

	v2.1+ uses a new configuration method, but allows the installation
	  of IPCUST.SYS for backward compatibility with other software which
	  must read the PC/TCP configuration

	  driver + 1Ah if Stacker controls this drive
	  unchanged else
Notes:	in addition to returning the address of the Stacker device driver,
	  this call also sets the volume number at offset 58h in the device
	  driver (see #2205 at INT 25/AX=CDCDh)
	Stacker Anywhere does not link its built-in device driver into
	  the standard device driver chain, but it can be found via CDS/DPB
	this call can be used as an installation check for all versions of
	  Stacker and Stacker Anywhere to avoid the INT 25 call

	some of these entry points (22h,23h,24h,2Eh,2Fh) are replaced as soon
	  as COMMAND.COM is loaded, and return immediately to the caller, some
	  returning an error code (the original handler for INT 2F returns
	  AL=03h [fail]).

Notes:	moving file pointer for either handle will also move it for the other,
	  because both will refer to the same system file table
	for DOS versions prior to 3.3, file writes may be forced to disk by
	  duplicating the file handle and closing the duplicate

	    AX = error code (07h,08h) (see #1332 at AH=59h/BX=0000h)
	    BX = size of largest available block
Notes:	DOS 2.1-6.0 coalesces free blocks while scanning for a block to
	  allocate
	.COM programs are initially allocated the largest available memory
	  block, and should free some memory with AH=49h before attempting any
	  allocations
	under the FlashTek X-32 DOS extender, EBX contains a protected-mode

Return: CF clear if successful
	CF set on error
	    AX = error code (07h,09h) (see #1332 at AH=59h/BX=0000h)
Notes:	apparently never returns an error 07h, despite official docs; DOS 2.1+
	  code contains only an error 09h exit
	DOS 2.1-6.0 does not coalesce adjacent free blocks when a block is
	  freed, only when a block is allocated or resized
	the code for this function is identical in DOS 2.1-6.0 except for
	  calls to start/end a critical section in DOS 3.0+

	    AX = error code (07h,08h,09h) (see #1332 at AH=59h/BX=0000h)
	    BX = maximum paragraphs available for specified memory block
Notes:	under DOS 2.1-6.0, if there is insufficient memory to expand the block
	  as much as requested, the block will be made as large as possible
	DOS 2.1-6.0 coalesces any free blocks immediately following the block

		INT 21/AH=62h
	CF set on error
	    AX = error code (01h,02h,05h,08h,0Ah,0Bh) (see #1332 at AH=59h)
Notes:	DOS 2.x destroys all registers, including SS:SP
	under ROM-based DOS, if no disk path characters (colons or slashes)
	  are included in the program name, the name is searched for in the
	  ROM module headers (see #1247) before searching on disk
	for functions 00h and 01h, the calling process must ensure that there
	  is enough unallocated memory available; if necessary, by releasing
	  memory with AH=49h or AH=4Ah
	for function 01h, the AX value to be passed to the child program is put
	  on top of the child's stack
	for function 03h, DOS assumes that the overlay is being loaded into
	  memory allocated by the caller
	function 01h was undocumented prior to the release of DOS 5.0
	some versions (such as DR DOS 6.0) check the parameters and parameter
	  block and return an error if an invalid value (such as an offset of
	  FFFFh) is found
	background programs under European MS-DOS 4.0 must use the new
	  executable format
	this function ignores the filename extension, instead checking the
	  first two bytes of the file to determine whether there is a valid
	  .EXE header (see #1246); if not, the file is assumed to be in .COM
	  format.  If present, the file may be in any of several formats which
	  are extensions of the original .EXE format (see #1245)
	.COM-format executables begin running with the following register
	  values:
		AL = 00h if first FCB has valid drive letter, FFh if not
		AH = 00h if second FCB has valid drive letter, FFh if not
		CS,DS,ES,SS = PSP segment
		SP = offset of last word available in first 64K segment
		(note: AX is always 0000h under DESQview)
	old-format executables begin running with the following register
	  values:
		AL = 00h if first FCB has valid drive letter, FFh if not
		AH = 00h if second FCB has valid drive letter, FFh if not
		DS,ES = PSP segment
		SS:SP as defined in .EXE header
		(note: AX is always 0000h under DESQview)
	new executables begin running with the following register values
		AX = environment segment
		BX = offset of command tail in environment segment
		CX = size of automatic data segment (0000h = 64K)
		ES,BP = 0000h
		DS = automatic data segment
		SS:SP = initial stack
	  the command tail corresponds to an old executable's PSP:0081h and
	  following, except that the 0Dh is turned into a NUL (00h); new
	  format executables have no PSP
	under the FlashTek X-32 DOS extender, only function 00h is supported
	  and the pointers are passed in DS:EDX and ES:EBX
	DR DOS 6 always loads .EXE-format programs with no fixups and
	  .COM-format programs starting with 9Ch 55h (PUSHF/PUSH BP) above the
	  64K mark to avoid the EXEPACK bug, by extending the memory block
	  containing the program's environment; this code is disabled if the
	  name of the parent program as stored in the MCB is 'WIN'.
BUGS:	DOS 2.00 assumes that DS points at the current program's PSP
	Load Overlay (subfunction 03h) loads up to 512 bytes too many if the
	  file contains additional data after the actual overlay

Notes:	for search attributes other than 08h, all files with at MOST the

	  will be returned.  Under DOS 2.x, searching for attribute 08h
	  (volume label) will also return normal files, while under DOS 3.0+
	  only the volume label (if any) will be returned.
	this call also returns successfully if given the name of a character
	  device without wildcards.  DOS 2.x returns attribute 00h, size 0,
	  and the current date and time.  DOS 3.0+ returns attribute 40h and
	  the current date and time.
	immediately after an INT 2F/AX=B711h (APPEND return found name), the
	  name at DS:DX will be overwritten; if AL=00h on entry, the actual
	  found pathname will be stored, otherwise, the actual found path
	  will be prepended to the original filespec without a path.
	under LANtastic, this call may be used to obtain a list of a server's
	  shared resources by searching for "\\SERVER\*.*"; a list of printer
	  resources may be obtained by searching for "\\SERVER\@*.*"
	under the FlashTek X-32 DOS extender, the filespec pointer is in DS:EDX
BUGS:	under DOS 3.x and 4.x, the second and subsequent calls to this function
	  with a character device name (no wildcards) and search attributes
	  which include the volume-label bit (08h) will fail unless there is
	  an intervening DOS call which implicitly or explicity performs a
	  directory search without the volume-label bit.  Such implicit
	  searches are performed by CREATE (AH=3Ch), OPEN (AH=3Dh), UNLINK
	  (AH=41h), and RENAME (AH=56h)
	DR DOS 3.41 and 5.0 return the Directory attribute for the volume label

	since the entire state of a FindFirst/FindNext sequence is contained

Notes:	partially supported by OS/2 v1.1 compatibility box (however, most

	on return, ES points at the DOS data segment (see also INT 2F/AX=1203h)
	Quarterdeck's suggested check for the use of its DOSDATA.SYS or
	  DOS-UP.SYS is to test whether the list-of-lists segment is greater
	  than the segment of the first memory block; a better check for
	  DOS-UP.SYS is INT 21/AX=2B01h/CX=444Dh
	because not all DOS workalikes support all fields in the List of Lists,
	  applications should ensure that pointers are neither 0000h:0000h
	  nor FFFFh:FFFFh before using them
	Windows for Workgroups 3.11 network and Windows95 set the path to
	  the local drive and directory even for network drives; in that
	  case the UNC form \\SERVER\SHARE can be obtained with

	  same even for INT 21/AX=5F02h
	Windows95 GUI no longer returns the true path for a SUBSTed drive,

Notes:	the next MCB is at segment (current + size + 1)
	under DOS 3.1+, the first memory block is the DOS data segment,
	  containing installable drivers, buffers, etc.	 Under DOS 4.0+ it is
	  divided into subsegments, each with its own memory control block
	  (see #1285), the first of which is at offset 0000h.
	for DOS 5+, blocks owned by DOS may have either "SC" or "SD" in bytes
	  08h and 09h.	"SC" is system code or locked-out inter-UMB memory,
	  "SD" is system data, device drivers, etc.
	Some versions of DR DOS use only seven characters of the program name,
	  placing a NUL in the eighth byte.

	normally, only one of bits 13&12 may be set together with bit 14, but
	  DR DOS 5.0 uses other combinations for bits 15-12: 0111 JOIN,
	  0001 SUBST, 0101 ASSIGN (see #1296)
	Windows for Workgroups 3.11 network sets the path to the local
	  drive and directory even for network drives; in that case the
	  UNC form \\SERVER\SHARE can be obtained with INT 21/AX=5F02h
	  or INT 21/AX=5F46h. LapLink RemoteAccess does the same even for
	  INT 21/AX=5F02h
	SoftWindows on the Macintosh PowerPC sets \\E for the host drive

	(DOS 3.0+) marks "no inherit" file handles as closed in child PSP
	this function is implemented using the same code as AH=26h, so unlike

	open files should not be renamed
	(DOS 2.x only) this function renames file by creating a new directory
	  entry with the new name,then marking the old entry deleted
	(DOS 3.0+) allows renaming of directories
	(DOS 3.1+) wildcards are allowed if invoked via AX=5D00h, in which case
	  error 12h (no more files) is returned on success, and both source and
	  destination specs must be canonical (as returned by AH=60h).
	  Wildcards in the destination are replaced by the corresponding char
	  of each source file being renamed.  Under DOS 3.x, the call will fail
	  if the destination wildcard is *.* or equivalent; under DR DOS 5.0,
	  the call will fail if any wildcards are used.	 When invoked via
	  AX=5D00h, only those files matching the attribute mask in CL are
	  renamed.
	under the FlashTek X-32 DOS extender, the old-name pointer is in DS:EDX
	  and the new-name pointer is in ES:EDI (DS must equal ES)
BUG:	(DR DOS 3.41) when invoked via AX=5D00h, this function will generate

	the Get subfunction returns the last value set
	setting an allocation strategy involving high memory does not

	  explicitly with AX=5803h in order to actually allocate high memory
	a program which changes the allocation strategy should restore it
	  before terminating

	  MS-DOS; under DR DOS 3.41, wildcards corrupt the filesystem; and
	  under DR DOS 5.0-6.0, the call returns error code 03h due to improper
	  support for the server function call (refer to BUGS: section below)
	an extra file attribute parameter is enabled for OPEN (AH=3Dh),
	  DELETE (AH=41h), and RENAME (AH=56h)
	functions which take filenames require canonical names (as returned

BUGS:	the OS/2 2.0 DOS Boot Session incorrectly maps DOS drive letters,
	  seemingly ignoring HPFS drives
	DR DOS 5.0-6.0 merely recursively call INT 21 after loading the

Notes:	the Critical Error flag is used in conjunction with the InDOS flag

	setting CritErr flag allows use of functions 50h/51h from INT 28h under

	under DOS 4.0, AX=5D0Bh should be used instead of this function
	SHARE and other DOS utilities consult the byte at offset 04h in the
