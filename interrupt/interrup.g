Notes:	this function is passed through to INT 2F/AX=111Eh by the DOS kernel
	error code 12h is returned if BX is greater than the size of the list
	also supported by Banyan VINES, PC-NFS, LANtastic, and 10NET
	supported by LapLink RemoteAccess but returns the local drive letter;
	  the remote drive letter can be obtained with INT 2F/AX=Cxxxh
	  (see INT 2F/AX=C000h"LapLink")

	CF set on error
	    AX = error code (01h,03h,05h,08h,0Fh,12h) (see #1332 at AH=59h)
Notes:	if device type is disk drive, DS:SI must point at either a null string
	  or a string consisting the drive letter followed by a colon; if a
	  null string, the network attempts to access the destination without
	  redirecting a local drive
	the DOS kernel calls INT 2F/AX=111Eh with AX on top of the stack
	also supported by Banyan VINES, LANtastic, and 10NET

	  corresponding to the undocumented TRUENAME command in COMMAND.COM
Notes:	the input path need not actually exist
	letters are uppercased, forward slashes converted to backslashes,
	  asterisks converted to appropriate number of question marks, and
	  file and directory names are truncated to 8.3 if necessary.  (DR DOS
	  3.41 and 5.0 do not expand asterisks)
	'.' and '..' in the path are resolved
	filespecs on local drives always start with "d:", those on network
	  drives always start with "\\"
	if path string is on a JOINed drive, the returned name is the one that
	  would be needed if the drive were not JOINed; similarly for a
	  SUBSTed, ASSIGNed, or network drive letter.	Because of this, it is
	  possible to get a qualified name that is not legal under the current
	  combination of SUBSTs, ASSIGNs, JOINs, and network redirections
	under DOS 3.3 through 6.00, a device name is translated differently if
	  the device name does not have an explicit directory or the directory
	  is \DEV (relative directory DEV from the root directory works
	  correctly).  In these cases, the returned string consists of the
	  unchanged device name and extension appended to the string X:/
	  (forward slash instead of backward slash as in all other cases) where
	  X is the default or explicit drive letter.
	under MS-DOS 7.0, this call returns the short name for any
	  long-filename portions of the provided pathname or filename
	functions which take pathnames require canonical paths if invoked via
	  INT 21/AX=5D00h
	supported by OS/2 v1.1 compatibility box
	NetWare 2.1x does not support characters with the high bit set; early
	  versions of NetWare 386 support such characters except in this call.
	  In addition, NetWare returns error code 3 for the path "X:\"; one
	  should use "X:\." instead.
	Novell DOS 7 reportedly has difficulty with non-MS-DOS filenames on
	  network drives, and can return "D:" instead of "SERVER/VOLUME"
	for DOS 3.3-6.0, the input and output buffers may be the same, as the
	  canonicalized name is built in an internal buffer and copied to the
	  specified output buffer as the very last step
	for DR DOS 6.0, this function is not automatically called when on a
	  network.  Device drivers reportedly cannot make this call from their
	  INIT function.  Using the same pointer for both input and output
	  buffers is not supported in the April 1992 and earlier versions of
	  DR DOS
	Windows for Workgroups 3.11, Windows95 and even MS-DOS 7.00 only
	  return the local drive path; to obtain network paths use
	  INT 21/AX=5F02h or INT 21/AX=5F46h instead
	Corel's CORELCDX and MSCDEX without the /S switch return canonical
	  names of the form "\\D.\A.\path", where "D" is the CD-ROM drive
	  letter and "A" appears to indicate the first physical CD-ROM drive;
	  MSCDEX with the /S switch returns a canonical name with embedded
	  blanks.  Novell DOS 7 NWCDEX as of the 11/16/94 update returns the
	  same canonical path as MSCDEX; earlier revisions returned
	  "Cdex.   D:\path", where "D" is the CD-ROM drive letter
	the Windows95 MSCDEX-replacement VxD returns "D:\path", even though the
	  MS-DOS 7.00 MSCDEX behaves identically to older versions (above)

Desc:	adjust the size of the per-process open file table, thus raising or
	  lowering the limit on the number of files the caller can open
	  simultaneously
Notes:	if BX <= 20, no action is taken if the handle limit has not yet been
	  increased, and the table is copied back into the PSP if the limit
	  is currently > 20 handles
	for file handle tables of > 20 handles, DOS 3.30 never reuses the
	  same memory block, even if the limit is being reduced; this can lead
	  to memory fragmentation as a new block is allocated and the existing
	  one freed
	only the first 20 handles are copied to child processes in DOS 3.3-6.0
	increasing the file handles here will not, in general, increase the
	  number of files that can be opened using the runtime library of a
	  high-level language such as C
	Novell DOS 7 reportedly terminates the calling program if the JFT is
	  being reduced in size and there are any open file handles beyond
	  the portion of the JFT being retained
BUGS:	the original release of DOS 3.30 allocates a full 64K for the handle
	  table on requests for an even number of handles
	DR DOS 3.41 and 5.0 will lose track of any open file handles beyond
	  the portion of the JFT retained after the call; MS-DOS will indicate
	  error 04h if any of the JFT entries to be removed are open
