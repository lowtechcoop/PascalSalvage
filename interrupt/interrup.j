INT 2A - NETWORK - PC LAN PROG v1.31+ - GET LOGGED ON USER NAME
	AX = 7802h
	ES:DI -> 8-byte buffer to be filled
Return: AL = 00h if no user logged on to Extended Services
	AL <> 00h if user logged on to Extended Services
	    buffer at ES:DI filled with name, padded to 8 chars with blanks.
--------D-2A80-------------------------------
INT 2A CU - NETWORK - BEGIN DOS CRITICAL SECTION
	AH = 80h
	AL = critical section number (00h-0Fh) (see #2210)
Notes:	normally hooked to avoid interrupting a critical section, rather than
	  called
	the handler should ensure that none of the critical sections are
	  reentered, usually by suspending a task which attempts to reenter
	  an active critical section
	the DOS kernel does not invoke critical sections 01h and 02h unless it
	  is patched.  DOS 3.1+ contains a zero-terminated list of words
	  beginning at offset -11 from the Swappable Data Area
	  (see #1339 at INT 21/AX=5D06h); each word contains the offset within
	  the DOS data segment of a byte which must be changed from C3h (RET)
	  to 50h (PUSH AX) under DOS 3.x or from 00h to a nonzero value under
	  DOS 4.0+ to enable use of critical sections.	For DOS 4.0+, all
	  words in this list point at the byte at offset 0D0Ch.
	MS Windows patches the DOS kernel's calls to INT 2A/AH=80h-81h into
	  far calls to its own handler, and does not reflect the calls back
	  to INT 2A unless SYSTEM.INI contains ReflectDOSInt2A=1 or
	  ModifyDOSInt2A=0 in the [386Enh] section
	Novell NETX does not issue INT 2A/AH=80h and INT 2A/AH=81h calls when
	  it intercepts INT 21 calls and processes them itself
SeeAlso: AH=81h,AH=82h,AX=8700h,INT 21/AX=5D06h,INT 21/AX=5D0Bh

(Table 2210)
Values for DOS critical section number:
 01h	DOS kernel, SHARE.EXE, DOSMGR
	apparently for maintaining the integrity of DOS/SHARE/NET
	  data structures
 02h	DOS kernel, DOSMGR
	ensures that no multitasking occurs while DOS is calling an
	  installable device driver
 05h	network redirector
 06h	DOS 4.x only IFSFUNC
 08h	ASSIGN.COM
 0Ah	MSCDEX, CORELCDX
 0Fh	IBM PC LAN server (while intercepting INT 10/AH=06h,07h,0Eh)
--------D-2A81-------------------------------
INT 2A CU - NETWORK - END DOS CRITICAL SECTION
	AH = 81h
	AL = critical section number (00h-0Fh) (see #2210)
Notes:	normally hooked rather than called
	the handler should reawaken any tasks which were suspended due to an
	  attempt to enter the specified critical section
	MS Windows patches the DOS kernel's calls to INT 2A/AH=80h-81h into
	  far calls to its own handler, and does not reflect the calls back
	  to INT 2A unless SYSTEM.INI contains ReflectDOSInt2A=1 or
	  ModifyDOSInt2A=0 in the [386Enh] section
SeeAlso: AH=80h,AH=82h,AX=8700h
--------D-2A82-------------------------------
INT 2A CU - NETWORK - END DOS CRITICAL SECTIONS 0 THROUGH 7
	AH = 82h
Notes:	called by the INT 21h function dispatcher for function 0 and functions
	  greater than 0Ch except 59h, and on process termination
	the handler should reawaken any tasks which were suspended due to an
	  attempt to enter one of the critical sections 0 through 7
SeeAlso: AH=81h
--------N-2A84-------------------------------
INT 2A CU - NETWORK - KEYBOARD BUSY LOOP
	AH = 84h
Note:	similar to DOS's INT 28h, called from inside the DOS keyboard input
	  loop (i.e. INT 21/AH=07h or INT 21/AH=08h) to allow the network
	  software to process requests
SeeAlso: INT 28
--------N-2A86-------------------------------
INT 2A U - PC Network v1.00 - RECEIVER.COM - ???
	AH = 86h
	???
Return: ???
SeeAlso: AH=07h,AH=C4h
--------P-2A8700-----------------------------
INT 2A CU - PRINT - BEGIN BACKGROUND PRINTING
	AX = 8700h
	CF clear
Return: CF clear if OK to print in background now
	CF set if background printing not allowed at this time
Desc:	used to inform interested programs that PRINT is about to start its
	  background processing, and allow those programs to postpone the
	  processing if necessary
Notes:	when PRINT gains control and wants to begin printing, it calls this
	  function.  If CF is clear on return, PRINT begins its background
	  processing, and calls AX=8701h when it is done.  If CF is set on
	  return, PRINT will relinquish control immediately, and will not
	  call AX=8701h
	PCVENUS (an early network shell by IBM and CMU) hooks this call to
	  prevent background printing while its own code is active
SeeAlso: AH=80h,AH=81h,AX=8701h
--------P-2A8701-----------------------------
INT 2A CU - PRINT - END BACKGROUND PRINTING
	AX = 8701h
Desc:	used to inform interested programs that PRINT has completed its
	  background processing
Note:	called by PRINT after it has performed some background printing; not
	  called if AX=8700h returned with CF set.
SeeAlso: AX=8700h

INT 2C - STARLITE architecture - KERNEL API
Note:	STARLITE is an architecture by General Software for a series of MS-DOS

	  be released in 1991.	The interrupt number is subject to change
	  before the actual release.
--------m-2C---------------------------------
INT 2C R - Cloaking - CALL PROTECTED-MODE PASSALONG CHAIN
Notes:	when this interrupt is invoked in V86 mode, RM386 will invoke the first
	  in a chain of protected-mode handlers, and will only pass execution
	  to the V86-mode INT 2C handler if none of the handlers in the
	  passalong chain handle the call instead.  This is the method by which
	  the real-mode stub of a cloaked application communicates with the
	  protected-mode portion.
	the cloaking host calls the passalong chain with EAX=58494E33h ('WIN3')
	  when MS Windows starts up and with EAX=334E4958h ('3NIW') when
	  Windows shuts down; between these two broadcasts, the additional
	  Windows-only Cloaking services are available
	this function was first introduced with RM386 (RAM-MAN/386) v6.00, the
	  memory manager included in Helix Software's Netroom
SeeAlso: INT 2C/AX=0009h,INT 2F/AX=4310h"Cloaking"

Notes:	this INT 2C interface is used by Netroom's DPMI.EXE v3.00
	to access extended memory, set the base address to the desired
	  physical address plus 400000h (4M)

INT 2D - ALTERNATE MULTIPLEX INTERRUPT SPECIFICATION (AMIS) [v3.6]
	AH = multiplex number
	AL = function
	    00h installation check
	    01h get private entry point
	    02h uninstall
	    03h request popup
	    04h determine chained interrupts
	    05h get hotkey list
	    06h get device-driver information
	    07h-0Fh reserved for future enhancements
		Return: AL = 00h (not implemented)
	    other  application-dependent
	other registers vary by function (also see individual entries below)
Return: varies by function
Notes:	programs should not use fixed multiplex numbers; rather, a program
	  should scan all multiplex numbers from 00h to FFh, remembering the
	  first unused multiplex in case the program is not yet installed.
	  For multiplex numbers which are in use, the program should compare
	  the first 16 bytes of the signature string to determine whether it
	  is already installed on that multiplex number.  If not previously
	  installed, it should use the first free multiplex number.
	functions other than 00h are not valid unless a program is installed
	  on the selected multiplex number
	to be considered fully compliant with version 3.6 of the specification,
	  programs must implement at least functions 00h, 02h (no resident
	  uninstall code required), and 04h (return value 04h).	 TSRs that
	  provide hotkeys with which the user can activate them must also
	  implement function 05h.  TSRs which provide DOS device drivers must
	  also implement function 06h.	The absolute minimum fully-compliant
	  implementation has an overhead of 64 bytes (80 bytes with function
	  05h) plus 22 bytes per hooked interrupt (for the interrupt sharing
	  protocol header and hook list entry).
	the signature string and description may be used by memory mappers
	  to display the installed programs
	to be considered fully compliant, users of this specification must
	  adhere to the IBM interrupt sharing protocol (see #2223), which will
	  permit removal of TSRs in arbitrary order and interrupt handler
	  reordering.  All TSRs following this specification should be
	  removable unless they are loaded from CONFIG.SYS, though they need
	  not keep the code for removing themselves resident; it is acceptable
	  for a separate program to perform the interrupt unhooking and
	  memory-freeing steps of removal.
	A sample public-domain implementation including example TSRs and
	  utility programs may be found in a separate package distributed as
	  AMISLnnn.ZIP (AMISL092.ZIP as of this writing).
	Please let me know if you choose to follow this proposal.  The
	  signature and a list of the private API calls you use would be
	  appreciated, as well.

Format of interrupt sharing protocol interrupt handler entry point:
Offset	Size	Description	(Table 2223)
 00h  2 BYTEs	short jump to actual start of interrupt handler, immediately
		  following this data block (EBh 10h)
 02h	DWORD	address of next handler in chain
 06h	WORD	signature 424Bh
 08h	BYTE	EOI flag

 09h  2 BYTEs	short jump to hardware reset routine
		must point at a valid FAR procedure (may be just RETF)
 0Bh  7 BYTEs	reserved (0) by IBM for future expansion
Note:	when chaining to the prior handler, the interrupt handler must perform
	  an indirect jump/call using the address at offset 02h in the
	  ISP header.  This permits another AMIS TSR to hook itself into
	  the chain at a position other than as the first handler to receive
	  an interrupt.

Notes:	BL is ignored if the TSR returns AL=04h; in that case, the caller

Notes:	this call allows execution of arbitrary commands (including COMMAND.COM
	  internal commands) without loading another copy of COMMAND.COM
	if COMMAND.COM is the user's command interpreter, the primary copy
	  executes the command; this allows the master environment to be
	  modified by issuing a "SET" command, but changes in the master
	  environment will not become effective until all programs descended
	  from the primary COMMAND.COM terminate
	since COMMAND.COM processes the string as if typed from the keyboard,
	  the transient portion needs to be present, and the calling program
	  must ensure that sufficient memory to load the transient portion can
	  be allocated by DOS if necessary
	results are unpredictable if invoked by a program run from a batch file
	  because this call is not reentrant and COMMAND.COM uses the same
	  internal variables when processing a batch file
	hooked but ignored by 4DOS v3.0 COMMAND.COM replacement unless SHELL2E
	  has been loaded
	the MS-DOS 5 Programmer's Reference calls this "Reload Transient"

INT 2F - Multiplex - NOTES
	AH = identifier of program which is to handle the interrupt
	   00h-7Fh reserved for DOS
	   B8h-BFh reserved for networks
	   C0h-FFh reserved for applications
	AL is the function code
   This is a general mechanism for verifying the presence of a TSR and
   communicating with it.  When searching for a free identifier code for AH
   using the installation check (AL=00h), the calling program should set
   BX/CX/DX to 0000h and must not depend on any registers other than CS:IP
   and SS:SP to be valid on return, since numerous programs now use additional
   registers on input and/or output for the installation check.
Notes:	Since the multiplex chain is growing so long, and beginning to
	  experience multiplex number collisions, I have proposed an alternate
	  multiplex interrupt on INT 2D.  If you decide to use the alternate
	  multiplex, please let me know.
	DOS and some other programs return values in the flags register, so
	  any TSR which chains by calling the previous handler rather than
	  jumping to it should ensure that the returned flags are preserved
	  and passed back to the original caller

	  driver or TSR can watch for this broadcast and return the appropriate
	  values.  If the driver or TSR returns CX <> 0, it is also its
	  responsibility to display an error message.
	each handler must first chain to the prior INT 2F handler with
	  registers unchanged before processing the call
	if the handler requires local data on a per-VM basis, it must store the
	  returned ES:BX in the "next" field of a startup info structure and
	  return a pointer to that structure in ES:BX
	a single TSR may set the V86 mode enable/disable callback; if DS:SI is
	  already nonzero, the TSR must fail the initialization by setting CX
	  nonzero
	MSD checks for Windows 3.0 running in standard mode by testing whether
	  CX=FFFFh and other registers are unchanged on return
	Novell DOS v7.0 (Update 8 - Update 11) TASKMGR in multitasking mode

INT 2F - MS Windows - GET DEVICE API ENTRY POINT
	AX = 1684h
	BX = virtual device (VxD) ID (see #2290)
	ES:DI = 0000h:0000h
Return: ES:DI -> VxD API entry point, or 0:0 if the VxD does not support an API
Note:	some Windows enhanced-mode virtual devices provide services that
	  applications can access.  For example, the Virtual Display Device
	  (VDD) provides an API used in turn by WINOLDAP.

Notes:	The high bit of the VxD ID is reserved for future use. Originally,
	  the next 10 bits were the OEM number which was assigned by Microsoft,
	  and the low 5 bits were the device number.  Currently, Microsoft
	  assigns VxD IDs individually for each driver; send blank email to
	  vxdid@microsoft.com for more information.
	"CallOut"=Y indicates that the VxD uses the INT 2F/AX=1607h/BX=VxDID
	  device callout interface; "PM" and "V86" indicate whether the VxD
	  provides an API entry point in protected mode and Virtual-86 mode
	  (e.g. DOS boxes)

Note:	The PSCs are planted in SHELLB workspace by SHELLC, the user
	  menu interface.  The final PSC of a sequence is finished with a
	  GOTO COMMON, which causes a loop back in the batch file which called
	  SHELLC so as to execute SHELLC again.	 The check on batch file name
	  permits PSCs to CALL nested batch files while PSCs are still stacked
	  up for subsequent execution.
