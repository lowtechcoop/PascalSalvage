INT 21 u - Novell NetWare v3.01+ shell interface - MULTIPLEXOR
	AH = F2h
	AL = function (see #1750)
	    (subfunction stored in various places in the request packet,
	    depending on function number; see individual entries)
	CX = length of request buffer
	DX = length of reply buffer (0000h if no reply packet)
	DS:SI -> request buffer
	ES:DI -> reply buffer (ignored if DX=0000h)
Return: AX = status (see #2507 at INT 2F/AX=7A20h/BX=0000h)
	reply buffer filled as appropriate for function
Note:	this is a multiplexor providing a "raw" interface to the underlying
	  NetWare Core Protocol.  Many functions which were accessed via a
	  separate AH function in older versions can also be accessed here,
	  but some NetWare 3.x calls appear to be available only here.

Desc:	this vector specifies the address of the routine which is to be given

Notes:	this vector is restored from the DWORD at offset 0Ah in the PSP during

	normally points at the instruction immediately following INT 21/AH=4Bh

	CF clear
Return: all registers preserved

	    DOS will abort program with errorlevel 0
	else (RETF/RETF 2 with CF clear or IRET with CF ignored)
	    interrupted DOS call is restarted
Notes:	this interrupt is invoked whenever DOS detects a ^C or ^Break; it
	  should never be called directly
	MS-DOS 1.25 also invokes INT 23 on a divide overflow (INT 00)
	MS-DOS remembers the stack pointer before calling INT 23, and if it is
	  not the same on return, pops and discards the top word; this is what
	  permits a return with RETF as well as IRET or RETF 2
	MS-DOS 2.1+ ignores the returned CF if SP is the same on return as it
	  was when DOS called INT 23, so RETF 2 will not terminate the program
	Novell DOS 7 always pops a word if CF is set on return, so one should
	  not return with RETF 2 and CF set or IRET with the stored flags' CF
	  set
	any DOS call may safely be made within the INT 23 handler, although
	  the handler must check for a recursive invocation if it does
	  call DOS

Notes:	invoked when a critical (usually hardware) error is encountered by DOS
	  (see #2198); should never be called directly
	when DOS terminates a program, it copies the previous value of the
	  INT 24 vector out of the PSP (see #1032) and into the interrupt
	  vector table
SeeAlso: INT 21/AH=95h

(Table 2198)
Values critical error handler is called with:
	AH = type and processing flags (see #2199)
	AL = drive number if AH bit 7 clear
	BP:SI -> device driver header (see #1298 at INT 21/AH=52h)
		(BP:[SI+4] bit 15 set if character device)
	DI low byte contains error code if AH bit 7 set (see #2200)
	STACK:	DWORD	return address for INT 24 call
		WORD	flags pushed by INT 24
		WORD	original AX on entry to INT 21
		WORD	BX
		WORD	CX
		WORD	DX
		WORD	SI
		WORD	DI
		WORD	BP
		WORD	DS
		WORD	ES
		DWORD	return address for INT 21 call
		WORD	flags pushed by INT 21
Return: AL = action code (see #2201)
	SS,SP,DS,ES,BX,CX,DX preserved
Notes:	the only DOS calls the handler may make are INT 21/AH=01h-0Ch,30h,59h
	if the handler returns to the application by popping the stack, DOS
	  will be in an unstable state until the first call with AH > 0Ch
	for DOS 3.1+, IGNORE (AL=00h) is turned into FAIL (AL=03h) on network
	  critical errors
	if IGNORE specified but not allowed, it is turned into FAIL
	if RETRY specified but not allowed, it is turned into FAIL
	if FAIL specified but not allowed, it is turned into ABORT
	(DOS 3.0+) if a critical error occurs inside the critical error
	  handler, the DOS call is automatically failed (AL set to 03h and
	  the INT 24 call skipped)

Bitfields for critical error type and processing flags:
Bit(s)	Description	(Table 2199)

Desc:	This interrupt is invoked each time one of the DOS character input
	  functions loops while waiting for input.  Since a DOS call is in
	  progress even though DOS is actually idle during such input waits,
	  hooking this function is necessary to allow a TSR to perform DOS
	  calls while the foreground program is waiting for user input.	 The
	  INT 28h handler may invoke any INT 21h function except functions
	  00h through 0Ch.
Notes:	under DOS 2.x, the critical error flag (the byte immediately after the
	  InDOS flag) must be set in order to call DOS functions 50h/51h from
	  the INT 28h handler without destroying the DOS stacks.
	calls to INT 21/AH=3Fh,40h from within an INT 28 handler may not use a
	  handle which refers to CON
	at the time of the call, the InDOS flag (see INT 21/AH=34h) is normally
	  set to 01h; if larger, DOS is truly busy and should not be reentered
	the default handler is an IRET instruction
	supported in OS/2 compatibility box
	the _MS-DOS_Programmer's_Reference_ for DOS 5.0 incorrectly documents
	  this interrupt as superseded

Notes:	if BX=0001h, 0003h, 0007h or 0008h the whole screen will be

	this function doesn't perform the dump, it only requests it;
