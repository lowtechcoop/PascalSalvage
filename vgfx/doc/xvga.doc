1. About this document
======================---------------------------------------------------------
This document is part of the XVGA package which has been eagerly awaited of
quite a few on the internet. Some time ago I released a copy of my XVGA
graphics library for 320 x 200 in 256 colors vga mode. Alas, this didn't
include any documentation or examples of using this library, so I've had
a lot of email asking about parameters to procedures, examples, documentation
and other miscellaneous questions. I started to write a documentation in
Word for Windows 6.0, but this was lost in a harddisk crash. This may have
been a blessing in disguise, as I found out that noone is running Word
when they program. This documentation is written and meant to be a dos
ascii file, and should be viewable from both dos and windows.

The document is written in a particular random order, so you will have to do
a little search'n'find to get all the relevant information you need.

2. About the library
====================-----------------------------------------------------------
The library is a graphics library for 320 x 200 in 256 colors mode strongly
biased towards demo programming. It features 118 procedures and functions,
written in Borland Pascal 7.0, using BASM (Borland Inline assembler). It
is a 438,856 bytes pascal file, consisting of 22,321 lines of pascal code,
mostly in assembler.

4. Why should you try to reach me
=================================----------------------------------------------
I, as everybody else, loves praise. Therefore, you should send lots of mail
to me telling me how good XVGA is.

				REALITY CHECK!

Well, I would really like to have some feedback on the library. For starters
I would like to hear about problems using it, problems it causes, problems
with the documentation, bugs and other strange things. I know that the library
is not the clearest thing to use, and you will almost certainly have lots of
questions about how to use particular parts of it.

In particular, if you change or add to the library, send me an updated copy
along with any comments as to why you did it, and you will be credited for
what you did in the next release.

5. System requirements
======================---------------------------------------------------------
To compile the library into a .TPU file (yes, it is a unit), you will need
at the very least Borland Pascal 6.0. I have not tried it under 6.0, since I
use Borland Pascal 7.0 myself, and can therefore not positively say that it
will work or compile under 6.0. As far as I can see it, it should work, but
you will have to try for yourselves.

To run a program using the library you will need at least a 386. This is
because the library makes extensive use of the 32-bit math instructions
in the 386 and higher processors for optimum performance. The library will
check this itself (see at the end of XVGA.PAS) and report an error if you
try to run the program on a 286 or lower processor. Also, you will need
a VGA compatible monitor and video card for this library to work. This is not
checked by the library, so it will happily churn along on an EGA, and possibly
creating weird looking images, or possibly hanging the computer.

6. Disclaimer
=============------------------------------------------------------------------
Although I have tested 90 % of the routines in this library, I have not
tested all of them. Quite a few of them (all the XQuadra variants as an
example) is created by using cut-and-past-and-modify so they should all work,
but as I mentioned, not all of them are tested. I do not think that there
should be any strange effects from using the libraries, as long as you
supply valid parameters. For instance, don't supply the value 0 as VideoSeg
for the procedures needing this parameter. This is a sure way to crash the
computer.

I do not take responsibility for the use or misuse or results of such usage
(or misusage; phew) of the library. All damaged equipment (doubtful) is
your problem, not mine. That said, it is extremely difficult to damage any
equipment with this library, as the most likely culprit (XMode) has been
changed; see section 7.

You, the user or programmer, may use this library as you wish. You have all
rights to modify or extract parts of this library for own libraries. The
reason for this "all-rights-dropped" is that I have in the past done the
same myself, and should therefore not be sour by anyone doing this. This does
not mean that the code in this library is stolen from someone. I have created
the whole of this library from scratch, and almost all of the routines are
created from my own algorithms. The texture mapping algorithm and technique
is from Dr. Dobbs Journal (forgot which issue) and the PCX algorithm is
from ZSoft's reference, but the rest is my own work. The library is thus
completely shareware, public domain, freeware, and anyware. I would like,
however, that you credit me if you use the library.

7. Change in XMode from last release
====================================-------------------------------------------
For the lot of you who has already downloaded a copy of the first release, you
might notice that XMode has changed. The old XMode let you supply the mode
value as the parameter, and one user reported to me that his monitor stopped
working when he experimented with different values for this parameter. Only
parameter $13 (19 decimal) was valid here, or $3 (back to text-mode), so
a Boolean parameter was substituted.

8. Debugging the library
========================-------------------------------------------------------
If you want to debug a particular procedure or function in the library, you
will need to copy the offending procedure or function into the program
file in order to be able to debug it. The reason for this is that debugging
information must be turned off for the XVGA.PAS file. This is because pascal
complaints about the "symbol table" becoming full at some point in the file,
and cannot retain the debugging information.

9. Procedure and Function reference
===================================--------------------------------------------

General notes.

	˛ All X.., Y.. and Z.. parameters are considered coordinates. Although
	  some procedures and function accepts 32-bit (longint) parameters,
	  you should limit the values to +/- 32767, as the internal graphics
	  engine scales the values up by 65536 in order to gain acceptable
	  accuracy without floating point.
	˛ The VideoSeg parameter is the segment of the screen you want to
	  draw to. This is $A000 (40960 decimal) for the video screen you
	  look at, but if you want to draw graphics to a "hidden" screen,
	  supply the correct segment here. Look at the examples for a
	  better understanding of the usage and reason for this parameter.
	˛ All Glenz??? procedures are special effects versions of the
	  same procedure without the Glenz??? name. For instance, the
	  XQuadra will fill a 4-sided area with the given color, whilst
	  XQuadraGlenzXOR will xor the area with the given color
	˛ All procedure that hasn't got Clip in their names clip at the
	  edge of the screen. The Clip procedures has four parameters
	  ClipX1, ClipY1, ClipX2 and ClipY2 which specifies the area to
	  clip to. This area HAS to be inside the screen (0,0)-(319,199)
	  or strange results may occur. Notice that it is faster to use
	  the procedures that clip at the edge than using the
	  Clip... procedures with the clipping coordinates 0,0,319,199, since
	  the first procedure uses smaller and tighter code.
	˛ Tetragon means 3-sided, quadragon means 4-sided, and polygon
	  means n-sided.
	˛ 3D-coordinates are specified as follows:

		  x: -32767..+32767   = Left to right
		  y: -32767..+32767   = Top to bottom
		  z: -32767..+32767   = Front to back of monitor

Returns >=0 when the tetragon with the given corner coordinates are visible,
and <0 when invisible. The coordinates should be specified in a clock-wise
direction for this to be true. If you specify them in a anticlock-wise
direction, it returns <=0 when visible. Use this in conjunction with
3d-rotation.

Calculates the face normal of the tetragon. The three sets of coordinates
(x,y,z) specifies the three corners of the tetragon. The normal vector
is returned in the X,Y,Z parameters.

Does the same as Normal (actually, uses Normal), but also returns a normalized
z-value. The z-value is the result of the function call, and ranges from
-1.0 to +1.0. This can be used for lightsourcing and other effects.

These procedures fill a tetragon with the given color. The coordinates
X1,Y1,X2,Y2,X3,Y3 specified the three corners of the tetragon, the Color
parameter specifies the color of the tetragon, and VideoSeg the segment to
draw the tetragon on. Here is a short description of all the routines in
particular:

   XTetra	      - Normal tetragon
   XTetraClip	      - Normal tetragon, but specify clipping coordinates
   XTetraGlenzADD     - Pixel = Pixel + Color (otherwise normal)
   XTetraGlenzADDClip - Pixel = Pixel + Color, (otherwise as XTetraClip)
     ...
   XTetraCopy	      - Copy pixels from the FromSeg screen

Procedure AsmRotate32(Var SourcePoints,DestPoints : Array Of TPoint32;

This procedures rotates all the points in SourcePoints and places them in
DestPoints. The number of points to rotate is specified in PointCount, and
the amount to rotate around the three axes is in RX,RY,RZ. The rotation is
as follows:

	   RX = Around x-axis, positive is inwards at the top
	   RY = Around y-axis, positive is inwards at the left
	   RZ = Around z-axis, positive is clock-wise

This procedure uses the _S and _C variables which are Sin and Cos tables
used for lookup of rotation constants. These tables must be initialized with
InitSinCos before AsmRotate32 is called.

Adjusts all the points in the array Points by adding _DX,_DY and _DZ to the
coordinate values. For instance, if you have a object centered around
(0,0,0), you may move it to the center of the screen by using

	 MovePoints32(Points,PointCount,160,100,0);

‹‹‹‹‹‹‹‹‹‹‹‹‹‹‹‹‹‹‹‹‹‹‹‹‹‹‹‹‹‹‹‹‹‹‹‹‹‹‹‹‹‹‹‹‹‹‹‹‹‹‹‹‹‹‹‹‹‹‹‹‹‹‹‹‹‹‹‹‹‹‹‹‹‹‹‹‹‹‹

Adjusts the array of points in Points by applying perspective to them. The
formula for applying perspective is:

	NewX = (OldX SHL ShiftFactor) DIV (OldZ+ZDelta);
	NewY = (OldY SHL ShiftFactor) DIV (OldZ+ZDelta);

A sample call (with rather good values) is:

	AddPerspective(Points,PointCount,8,200);

‹‹‹‹‹‹‹‹‹‹‹‹‹‹‹‹‹‹‹‹‹‹‹‹‹‹‹‹‹‹‹‹‹‹‹‹‹‹‹‹‹‹‹‹‹‹‹‹‹‹‹‹‹‹‹‹‹‹‹‹‹‹‹‹‹‹‹‹‹‹‹‹‹‹‹‹‹‹‹

Creates the Sin and Cos lookup tables _S and _C by filling them with
sin and cos values. The values range from -256 to + 256 and are integer
values. The number of values (angles) in the tables is:

	1 SHL BitSize

For instance, the call:

	InitSinCos(10);

will create these tables (equivalent of):

     _S^[0..1023] Of Integer;
     _C^[0..1023] Of Integer;

InitSinCos also initializes the TableMask value to the highest index for
the tables. You may then use constructs like:

	    Angle := (Angle+Delta) And TableMask;

to wrap around the ends of the tables.

These three procedures does almost the same thing: they wait for the vertical
retrace to occur. When the video screen is redrawn on the monitor, a light
beam is moving rapidly from top to bottom of the monitor. For a 70Hz monitor,
this is done 70 times per second. If you happen to update the video contents
when this happens, you may see small glitches in the graphics; some parts
of the screen has been changed, whilst other parts hasn't. To avoid this, you
may start all updates of the contents when the beam moves back from the bottom
towards the top (it doesn't update the monitor during this). This is called
the vertical retrace.

The VRet procedure simply waits for the beam to reach the bottom before it
returns. TestCPU and TestCPULine uses color 0 to show how much time you have
left to update the screen, and still use only one "frame" per video update. One
frame is considered the time it takes the beam to go from the top to the bottom,
and then back to the top again.

These procedures clear the video screen, either to color 0, or to a specified
color. The Part procedures also allow you to clear only a portion (or part)
of the screen.

The Show procedures copies the screen to segment $A000 which is the visible
screen on your monitor. This allows you to set aside a portion of memory for
a "fake" screen, do all the drawing on this screen, and then rapidly copy the
"fake" screen to the visible screen. See the accompanying examples for more
understanding of the usage and reason for this.

specified in SortCount. This procedure is used in conjunction with 3D

These procedures does the same thing as the XTetra procedures; the only
difference is that they create 4-sided areas instead of 3-sided areas. Note
that the coordinates must be specified in a clock-wise direction. You may
not create "fly" quadragons, like this:

	       X1 -------- X2
		  \	 /
		   \	/
		    \  /
		     \/
		     /\
		    /  \
		   /	\
		  /	 \

Although this particular example will work, Try rotating this 90 degress to one
side (tilt it to the right or left). This will then become a rectangular
area.

The texture in Texture (which is a single-width/height array of pixels)
will be scaled to fit the given area. This could be used to create
Wolfenstein 3D-like graphics. You could use XVZoomLine to draw the walls
(V stands for vertical) and XHZoomLine for the floors and ceilings (H for
horizontal). As an example, try plotting some graphics in the top line of
the screen (y=0), and use this code:

    For Y:=100 To 199 Do
	XHZoomLine(Y,0,(Y-100)*3,Ptr($A000,0),320,$A000);

You will then see how this operates.

This is routines for texture mapping into tetragons. The
X?,Y? is the on-screen coordinates of the tetragon. The TX?,TY? is the
coordinates of the texture to map into the tetragon. Imagine that you
have an image somewhere in memory (pointed to by Texture). In this image, you
select a triangular area you wish to use as a texture. The coordinates for
this area is specified in TX1,TY1,TX2,TY2,TX3,TY3. Now, you select three
new coordinates in X1,Y1,X2,Y2,X3,Y3 and when you call XTetraTexture320 with
these parameters the triangular area will be twisted, rotated or thwarted to
fit into the new area specified in X1,Y1,...

The SpaceCutZBuffer also needs a separate image for storing z-values as pixels.
The Z1,Z2,Z3 coordinates specified in the parameter list is the depth of the
three corners of the tetragon. The tetragon will then be mapped as normal,
but only those pixels which are drawn nearer the user than previous pixels
at the same position will be drawn. See the examples for more info.

These procedures are somewhat specicialized versions of the XTetraTexture
procedures in that they take the image in BitMap which is
BitMapWidth x BitMapHeight pixels in size, and scales it to fit into
(X1,Y1)-(X2,Y2). This is all done in a rectangular area so faster scaling is
done. In the transparent procedures you also supply a TranspColor. All pixels
in the image which has this color will not be drawn, allowing you to make
portions of the image transparent.

These works like the XScaleBitMap procedures, but they will not scale the
images at all. The images are simply copied (with clipping) to the screen.
The Translate procedures will also take an array[0..255] as the Translate
parameter. All pixels to be drawn are mapped into this array, and the value
at that place in the array is drawn instead.
