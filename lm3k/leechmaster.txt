leechmaster 3000 protocol spec 1.0
==================================


connecting
==========

TCP, port 0x690 :p

"logging in"
============

The server will not send you a banner of any kind
send:
LM3K 1000 blah\r\n
(where blah is whatever you want - it just shows up on the debug console anyway - i use it for user-agent ids :)
it will reply with
LM3K 1000 ok\r\n 
or similar (only the LM3K 1000 bits are important)

That's it. Note theres a 30 second inactivity timeout.

Client->Server commands
=======================

standard 3 digit code then data system
(note that all the \r\n's mean CR/LF - ie don't stick them in there literally, ranzer :p )

theres just

198 quit\r\n  <-- pretty obvious

110 [spec]\r\n
search spec for case insensitive substring search on names
no search on filesizes yet, or any fancy wildcarding.
except * by itself returns everything

111 whatever\r\n <-- prints a test string

112 whatever\r\n <-- prints a test string

Server->Client commands
=======================

100 filesize fullpath\r\n  <-- you'll get a lot of these

199 list ends\r\n

200 random shite\r\n 
this one's for displaying the MOTD. it gets shoved at you just after the
LM3K 1000 ok etc on 'login'. Display it's contents somewhere prominent biatches!


Discovery protocol
==================

broadcast "LM3K something something\r\n" on UDP port 0x690
The server will reply back to you with "LM3K" something
